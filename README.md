# Pomodoro.  Not spaghetti sauce

##  Instructions

* Enter time in minutes (will get converted and displayed as seconds b/c math is for losers)
* Each _time_ cycle will repeat 3 times.  The first 2 breaks are 5 minutes, the last is 15 minutes.  
* Popup (message) boxes pause the program after each cycle allowing you to finish your work or break before going to the next cycle.
* The interface is real bad because it was only supposed to be the popup, then I decided at the end to have varying timer amounts.
  
## Caveats

* Python was used because I didn't have Java or VisualStudio installed on this laptop, so just deal with the interface.  You only have to put in 1 number.  It's the best my minimum effort will get you.

## Instructions 4 Friends

* Make sure you have updated Python and installed to path.  This does not use any non-standard packages because it is very simple, but if your attention span as bad or worse than mine (or close) it may be useful.  Because screw in-app purchaes or webapps being the only option.
* Make your directory, open a terminal in it, and clone the link to it. Type:


  `init git`

  `git clone https://github.com/hortw1991/Pomodoro-Timer.git`

*  Or fork it and do your thing, this is about convenience, not breakthrough. Then: 
  
  
    `cd whereeveryouputit`


    `python pomodoro.py`
